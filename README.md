Some examples of how [jsbgym](https://github.com/sryu1/jsbgym) can be used

```console
pip install git+https://github.com/sryu1/jsbgym git+https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3@feat/gymnasium-support git+https://github.com/Stable-Baselines-Team/stable-baselines3-contrib@feat/gymnasium-support
```
With the default hyperparamaters, I have observed a really sharp fall in rewards after 4 million steps, please tell me if you find a successful hyperparameter! :)
