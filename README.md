Some examples of how [jsbgym](https://github.com/sryu1/jsbgym) can be used

```console
pip install jsbgym stable-baselines3==2.0.0a1
```
With the default hyperparamaters for turnheadingtask, I have observed a really sharp fall in rewards after 4 million steps, please tell me if you find a successful hyperparameter! :)
